/**
 * 141. Linked List Cycle
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * 
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by 
 * continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node 
 * that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * 
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
